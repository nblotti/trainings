If the votes were equal, the final decision rested with UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin. Out of the 20 members on the UEFA Executive Committee, Reinhard Grindel (Germany) and Servet Yardımcı (Turkey) could not vote because they were ineligible. Lars-Christer Olsson (Sweden) was also absent due to illness. In total, 17 members were able to vote.\\nThe host was selected on 27 September 2018 in Nyon, Switzerland. Germany initially planned to fully host Euro 2020, although had not announced any firm interest by May 2012.\\n\\n\\n== Venues ==\\nGermany had a wide choice of stadiums that satisfied UEFA\\'s minimum capacity requirement of 30,000 seats for European Championship matches.\\nOf the ten venues selected for Euro 2024, nine were used for the 2006 FIFA World Cup: Berlin, Dortmund, Munich, Cologne, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Leipzig, Frankfurt, and Gelsenkirchen. Düsseldorf, which was not used in 2006 but had previously been used for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1988, will serve as the tenth venue; conversely, Hanover, Nuremberg and Kaiserslautern, host cities in 2006 (in addition to 1974 and 1988 in Hanover\\'s case), will not be used for this championship. Munich, the site of the first game of UEFA Euro 2024, was also a host city at the multi-national UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, hosting four matches (three involving Germany) in front of a greatly reduced number of spectators due to COVID-19 restrictions.\\nVarious other stadiums, such as those in Bremen and Mönchengladbach, were not selected. The area with the highest number of venues at UEFA Euro 2024 is the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with four of the ten host cities (Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Gelsenkirchen and Cologne).\\n\\n\\n=== Team base camps ===\\nEach team chose a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. The teams will train and reside in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases. The \"team base camp\" needs to be in Germany.\\n\\n\\n=== Ticketing ===\\nTickets for the venues were sold directly by UEFA via its website, or distributed by the football associations of the 24 finalists. Ticket sales started on 3 October 2023.  More than 80% of 2.7 million tickets for the 51 tournament matches were available for the fans of the participating teams and the general public.

The draw for the qualifying group stage took place at the Festhalle in Frankfurt on 9 October 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Qualified teams ==\\n\\n\\n== Format ==\\nThe format was similar to the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying competition: the group stage decided 20 of the 23 teams that would advance to the final tournament to join host Germany. The 53 UEFA member associations were divided into ten groups, with seven groups containing five teams and three containing six teams. The draw for the qualifying group stage took place on 9 October 2022, after conclusion of the league phase of the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League. The four UEFA Nations League Finals participants were drawn into groups of five teams (so they were able to compete in the Nations League Finals in June 2023). The qualifying group stage was played in a home-and-away, round-robin format on double matchdays in March, June, September, October, and November 2023. The winners and runners-up from the ten groups qualified directly to the final tournament.\\nFollowing the qualifying group stage, the remaining three teams were decided through the play-offs, held in March 2024. Twelve teams were selected based entirely on their performance in the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League. These teams were divided into three paths, each containing four teams, with one team from each path qualifying for the final tournament. The group winners of Nations Leagues A, B, and C automatically qualified for the play-off path of their league, unless they qualified for the final tournament via the qualifying group stage. If a group winner had already qualified through the qualifying group stage, they would be replaced by the next best-ranked team in the same league. However, if there were not enough non-qualified teams in the same league, then the spot would go first to the best-ranked group winner of League D, unless that team had already qualified for the final tournament. The remaining slots were then allocated to the next best team in the Nations League overall ranking. However, group winners of Leagues B and C could not face teams from a higher league.\\nThe three play-off paths each featured two single-leg semi-finals, and one single-leg final. In the semi-finals, the best-ranked team hosted the lowest-ranked team, and the second-ranked team hosted the third-ranked team. The host of the final was drawn between the winners of the semi-final pairings. The three play-off path winners joined the twenty teams that already qualified for the final tournament through the group stage.\\n\\n\\n=== Tiebreakers for group ranking ===\\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:\\n\\nHigher number of points obtained in the matches played among the teams in question;\\nSuperior goal difference in matches played among the teams in question;\\nHigher number of goals scored in the matches played among the teams in question;\\nIf, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 were reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 11 applied;\\nSuperior goal difference in all group matches;\\nHigher number of goals scored in all group matches;\\nHigher number of away goals scored in all group matches;\\nHigher number of wins in all group matches;\\nHigher number of away wins in all group matches;\\nFair play conduct in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card\")]"
